# NAME

EPICO::REST::Backend::EPICO - Native ElasticSearch backend class for EPICO REST API

# SYNOPSIS

    use EPICO::REST::Backend::EPICO;
    

# DESCRIPTION

EPICO::REST::Backend::EPICO is the native ElasicSearch backend, built on
top of BP-Schema-tools libraries, and the abstract class of the pluggable
backends on EPICO REST API.

It was initially created under the umbrella of [BLUEPRINT project](https://blueprint-epigenome.eu).

# RATIONALE

Instead of having a monolithic API, EPICO REST API was designed thinking
both on different instances of the same implementation, as well as pluggable
instances for other external sources.
